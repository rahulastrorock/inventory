Store inventory
this app is based on the idea of Store Inventory;
What Is Inventory?
Inventory is the term for the goods available for sale and raw materials used to produce goods available for sale
nventory can be valued in three ways. The first-in, first-out (FIFO) method says that the cost of goods sold is based on the cost of the earliest purchased materials, 
while the carrying cost of remaining inventory is based on the cost of the latest purchased materials. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method states that the cost of goods sold is
valued using the cost of the latest purchased materials, while the value of the remaining inventory is based on the earliest purchased materials
Whether you’re just starting your business or already have a business that is wholesale, retail, or a combination of the two, any product-based business 
owner knows that your inventory is your business. That’s why having a dependable, simple inventory management app is so important.

If you’re not paying attention to where your inventory is, how much you have available,
re-ordering needs, inventory financing, and so much more, you can easily be wasting your
money on products no one wants while missing opportunities to offer the products your customers are most excited about.
THANKYOU!!!!
